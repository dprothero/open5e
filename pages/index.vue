    <h2>The API</h2>
    <div class="side-note">
      <h3>Hey! Stuff is missing!</h3>
      <p>Some content you may be expecting was not released as part of the 5e SRD, so we arenâ€™t allowed to include it in this site.</p>
      <p>We are hoping to fill in the gaps using quality homebrew and 3rd party OGL content. Contact us or make a pull request if you know something we should add!</p>
    </div>
    <p>The <a href="https://api.open5e.com">Open5e API</a> includes all monsters and spells from the SRD as well as a search API, so you can easily access any part of the SRD from your app or website.</p>

    <p>The api-beta.open5e.com subdomain will remain indefinitely as the preview location for future API changes.</p>

    <p>We will also start working on creating more supporting art for the 5e SRD.</p>

    <h2>Bugs &amp; Issues</h2>
    <p>If you notice a bug or want to make a suggestion, join us on Discord to talk about it. Our discord is a place to talk about the redesign as well as rules, tools, art, gaming in general, or anything else on your mind!</p>
